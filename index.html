                    <h4>Consultation</h4>
                    <p>Your journey begins with a comprehensive consultation, either in-person or virtual. We discuss your goals, assess your suitability for the procedure, and create a personalized treatment plan. For virtual consultations, we request 5 pictures: 2 from sides, 1 front, 1 top, and 1 back of the head (for hair transplant consultations).</p>
                </li>
                
                <li class="process-step">
                    <h4>Procedure</h4>
                    <p>Procedures are performed using advanced techniques in our state-of-the-art facilities. Most procedures take between 4 to 8 hours, depending on the extent of treatment. Local anesthesia is used to ensure minimal discomfort during the procedure.</p>

                <li class="process-step">
                    <h4>Recovery</h4>
                    <p>The initial recovery phase typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks and may involve scabbing, mild swelling, and some discomfort. Post-operative pain is usually manageable with prescribed painkillers. Our team provides detailed aftercare instructions and ongoing support throughout your recovery.</p>

                    <p>While initial healing occurs within weeks, full results develop over time. For hair transplants, the transplanted hair may initially fall out (a normal part of the process), with new growth beginning after a few months. The full effect is usually visible after 9 to 12 months. We maintain follow-up care to ensure optimal outcomes.</p>

                        <p>Ideal candidates for a hair transplant are those who have sufficient donor hair to cover the balding areas.
